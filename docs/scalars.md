# Scalars
Scalars are primitive values: ``Int``, ``Float``, ``String``, ``Boolean``, or ``ID``.  
When calling the GraphQL API, you must specify nested subfields until you return only scalars.

## Boolean
Represents ``true`` or ``false`` values.

## ID
MongoDB Object ID

## Int
Represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2<sup>31</sup>) and 2<sup>31</sup> - 1.

## String
Represents textual data as UTF-8 character sequences. This type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.

## URI
An RFC 3986, RFC 3987, and RFC 6570 (level 4) compliant URI string.
